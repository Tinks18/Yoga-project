## UX
---
### **Strategy**

Considering the core UX principles I first started to think about the strategy for this website and defined who the target users would be and what features/technologies they would want.

Shubh Connectiosn's target users are:
* Aged 18-80
* Past/future yoga enthusiasts
* People interested in meditation and mindfullness
* Have an interest in visiting midefullness events

What these users would be looking for:
* Clear, concise, easy-to-find information
* Beautiful photos that provide inspiration and make the exercises look desirable
* Helpful guidance on courses available
* Recommendations for healthy eating habits

This website will offer all of these things whilst also allowing for intuitive navigation and comfortability of use. An effort was taken to not provide an overwhelming amount of information at first glance as this is often the reason people are put off with travel guides.

Due to the age group of the users, it is assumed that most users will be viewing the site on their mobile phones and therefore creating something responsive is integral to the design.

### **Scope**

In order to achieve the desired user & business goals, the following features will be included in this release:

- Header and menu bar, to navigate to various sections of the page
- Information section full of tips for yoga and minfullness 
- Interactive map for the route to the yoga studio
- Information, recommendations and advice for mindfullness meditation
- Gallery of images from the yoga and mediatation
- Course sign up form
- Links to affiliate social media pages

### **Structure** 

This is a single-page website to allow for desired flow; the navigation bar at the top allows for users to easily move to whatever section of the site they are interested in or they can simply scroll through the information as it is displayed. I chose the following order for the information 'Home > About us > Gallery > Meet the teacher> Conatct us ', as I felt this would allow the information to be digested in the best way. The text blocks are broken up with images to ensure interest is kept and there is no information overload at any point. There is a concise review of Shubh Connections before the more in-detail guide as I wanted users to be able to find these key bits of information quickly. Finally, there is a simple sign up form for users to sign up to the Shubh Connections's Yoga Website.

### **Skeleton**


Whilst building the website I felt that there were sections with too much information, for this reason, I opted to install the read more button on all devices and not just the mobile. This allows for user's to only read on if they would like the more detailed information; I felt giving the user this control would provide a positive user experience. 

I also decided to change my photo slideshow to a Fancybox gallery as I felt it looked cleaner and I preferred this method of interaction, it also allowed for better responsiveness and the images looked better on larger screens. 


### **Surface**

I chose a colour palette based around sunset and  bright light  as these colours remind me of the sea & being amongst nature; I want the users of this website to be transported to their memories of welbeing and calm  and believe these colours will help to do this. I paired these with a lighter off-white to allow for appropriate contrast. 


## The site structure:

The site has four links on the landing page that open different sections on the same page that can also be seen by scrolling down.
The six sections are:
- Navigation Bar
- About Us
- Gallery 
- Meet the Teacher
- Contact Us
- Footer


## Features 

  This is a fully responsive website that was designed mobile-first as this is the most likely way it will be viewed; the page is divided into the four sections listed in the navbar. Where a colour background has been used it has a slightly transparent opacity and the text is off-white. All of the headings use the font Josephine and the body text is sanserif, this consistency has been used across the website to create a coherent design.

The interesting bugs or problems discovered during testing, some of which have not been addressed yet.
- Bug:
  The individual pages opened on a new page beacuse I understood that as requied for all the links and not just the ones in the footer.
- Fix:
  removed the "_blank" for the navigation links in the header.
- Bug:
  when I used the a:hover it was true for all the links instead of just the header links
-  Fix:
   added inheritance to the navigation links in the header nav >li:hover instead of writing just a:hover 
-  Bug:
   the footer section was not immideately after the background 
   changed the height of the image class of the first section containg all the code in contact.html
-  Bug:
   All the website work was lost when gitpod auto reverted to the last commit and sent the website week back as the coomits were present and my end but were not git pushed
-  Fix: there was no fix to this I had to redo all the work and make a lot of website changes again and hence a lot features went missing as I      was left with little time on my hands.
-  Bug : 
   the git pod was auto changing the styles implemented .
-  Fix : Went back to the last commited style.css and copied to te current file to undo the changes and make the file work as before 
 



### Validator Testing 

- HTML
  - No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Ftinks18.github.io%2FYoga-project%2F)
- CSS
  - No errors were found when passing through the official [(Jigsaw) validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator)

### Unfixed Bugs

    the gitpod bug could not be dealt with but ended up wasting a lot of my time which in turn resulted in alot of things that coud not be added to the project. I wish they figure it  out. The commits that are done locally should not belost just because you close your workspace. 

## Deployment


- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab 
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
  - Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
